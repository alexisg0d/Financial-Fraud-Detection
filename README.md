# Financial Fraud Detection System

## Introduction

The features are scaled and the names of the features are not shown due to privacy reasons. Nevertheless, we can still analyze some important aspects of the dataset. The first thing we must do is gather a basic sense of our data. Except for the transaction and amount we don't know what the other columns are.

- The mean of all the amounts made is approximately USD 88, which is relatively small.
- There are no "Null" values, so we don't have to work on ways to replace values.
- Most of the transactions were Non-Fraud (99.83%) of the time, while Fraud transactions occurred (017%) of the time in the data frame.
