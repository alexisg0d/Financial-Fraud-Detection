# Financial Fraud Detection System

## Introduction

Recognition of fraudulent activity is extremely important for credit card companies. The chosen dataset contains transactions made by credit card holders from Europe during September 2013. The data was subject to a PCA transformation beforehand. The features are scaled and the names of the features are not shown due to privacy reasons. Nevertheless, we can still analyze some important aspects of the dataset. The first thing we must do is gather some basic information about the data. Except for the transaction and amount we don't know what the other columns (V1, V2,..., V28) are.

- The mean of all the amounts made is approximately USD 88, which is relatively small.
- There are no "Null" values, so we don't have to work on ways to replace values.
- Most of the transactions were Non-Fraud (99.83%) of the time, while Fraud transactions occurred (017%) of the time in the data frame.
